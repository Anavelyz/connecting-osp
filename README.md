# Connecting open science projects

A centralized platform with a searchable database and news feed could greatly improve the discoverability of the open source ecosystem. 

## Why?

The open source community is so big, with countless projects, it's a challenge to stay informed. Many projects remain unknown unless they are showcased at events or through grant proposals. This lack of visibility makes it difficult for community members to discover, connect, and collaborate effectively.

## What?

A centralized platform with a searchable database and news feed could greatly improve the discoverability of the open source ecosystem. Projects could share key information such as goals, contributor needs, and progress updates, allowing developers and users to easily find and connect with relevant initiatives. This centralized hub would foster greater collaboration and improve visibility across the community.

## Who?

Current contributors seeking projects or collaborators, new contributors exploring opportunities, and project leads looking for contributors and partners.
